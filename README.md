Best Trip Route Optimization: A Comparative Analysis of Dijkstra, A, and Bidirectional Algorithms for Road Networks

In today's world, finding the most efficient route for travel has become a critical aspect of various
applications, ranging from navigation systems to logistics and transportation planning. The concept
of the "best trip" is not only about minimizing travel time but also optimizing other factors such as
distance, cost, and resource utilization. To achieve this, shortest path algorithms play a pivotal role
in determining optimal routes on road networks.
Among the most widely used algorithms for shortest path problems are Dijkstra's algorithm, the A*
algorithm, and Bidirectional search. Each of these algorithms has its unique strengths and
weaknesses, making them suitable for different scenarios. Dijkstra's algorithm, known for its
accuracy and simplicity, guarantees the shortest path but can be computationally expensive for
large-scale networks. The A* algorithm, on the other hand, incorporates heuristics to improve
efficiency, making it particularly effective in scenarios where the goal node is known. Bidirectional
search further enhances performance by simultaneously exploring paths from both the source and
the destination.
This study aims to explore and compare these algorithms in the context of road networks, focusing
on their performance in finding the "best trip" routes. By analyzing their computational efficiency,
accuracy, and scalability, we seek to provide insights into their applicability in real-world scenarios.
The findings of this research will contribute to the ongoing development of intelligent transportation
systems and route optimization technologies.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of related work,
highlighting previous studies on shortest path algorithms. Section 3 outlines the methodology,
including the implementation details of the algorithms and the experimental setup. Section 4
presents the results and discusses the performance of each algorithm. Finally, Section 5 concludes
the study and suggests directions for future research.
